# Library Chair Organiser Swarm Bots - for Heritage Institue of Technology, Kolkata
(This is an awfull name for sure)

This organisation is built to provide documentation and workspace to maintain/develop the project in the future. Current chief maintainer's college-contact : shubhadeep.sarkar.cse24@heritageit.edu.in

Meet the [Team](https://github.com/LCOSB-HITK/TEAM)

## Project Objectives
- To build and maintain a small number (<=10) of tiny (smaller than a shoe box atleast) bots, capable of moving library chairs into appropriate positions (relative to tables) in an locally-independent but swarm-intelligent method(-ology), using cheap (as much as possible) and easily available/constructible hardware, implementing robust and highly efficient software.
- To have the project showcase advanced distributed info-ingestion and storage as well as distributed compute. Robust and efficient networking btw the bots and for analytic serving. Clever and efficient environment sensing algorithm/ML-model (AI image feed processing).
- To develop a team of students to cherish and put into practice, devlopment and maintance of such large multi-domain project (it's not that large tho).
- To make junior's feel cool and proud. And the team members BE cool and proud.

## Project High lvl Overview
- Locally-independent locomotion and elec-maintaince module
   - This module include all the machanics and electronics required in an unit. The actuator controls, power management, and low level process ochestration will be handled by this module. This module will also contain h/w determination and analytic serving code. Failure management and mechanical+s/w robustness is prime for this module
- Swarm Networking daemon-module
- Distributed Compute module
- Job scheduling module/protocol
-->
## Project Deadline [DELAYED as of 2023 09 05]
- June 2023 : single unit prototype ready; mechanical feasibility validated
- July 2023 : multi unit (>=3 units) prototype ready (swarm bot s/w integration); swarm intelligence and collaboration validated
- Sept 2023 : units produced at v1.0 cap (5 to 7 units); field deployment tested; unit local-independence/battery managment validated
- Oct 2023  : DEPLOYMENT in the library
- Dec 2023  : handing over chief maintainance
