# Library Chair Organiser Swarm Bots (for Heritage Institue of Technology, Kolkata)
(the system is **not** swarm intelligent rather a multi agent sys)

This organisation is built to provide documentation and workspace to maintain/develop the project in the future. Current chief maintainer's college-contact : shubhadeep.sarkar.cse24@heritageit.edu.in

## Project Objectives
- To build and maintain a small number (<=10) of tiny (smaller than a shoe box) bots, capable of moving library chairs into appropriate positions (relative to tables) in an locally-independent but shared database and task scheduler, using cheap (as much as possible) and easily available/constructible hardware, implementing robust and highly efficient software.
- To have the project showcase advanced distributed info-ingestion and storage as well as distributed compute. Robust and efficient networking btw the bots and for analytic serving. Clever and efficient environment sensing algorithm/ML-model (AI image feed processing).
- To develop a team of students to cherish and put into practice, devlopment and maintance of such large multi-domain project (it's not that large tho).
- To make junior's feel cool and proud. And the team members BE cool and proud.

## Project High lvl Overview
- Locally-independent locomotion and elec-maintaince module
   - This module include all the machanics and electronics required in an unit. The actuator controls, power management, and low level process ochestration will be handled by this module. This module will also contain h/w determination and analytic serving code. Failure management and mechanical+s/w robustness is prime for this module
- Swarm Networking daemon-module
- Distributed Compute module
- Job scheduling module/protocol
